Work done while participating in EYantra robotics competition 2018
We were given theme named "Pollinator bee" in which we have to hover our drone(PlutoX drone) over two terminals of a open circuit consisting of LEDs of same color. The objective was to design a efficient control system, so that the drone can hover stablly over the desired set point with minimum error and minimum oscillations.
